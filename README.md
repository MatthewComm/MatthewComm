👋 Hey there! I'm Matthew, also known as @MatthewComm.

🎓 I hold a BSc in Information Technology with Honours in Software Engineering, where I graduated cum laude. I am deeply passionate about crafting cutting-edge solutions and thrive in dynamic environments that align with my diverse expertise in software engineering.

👨‍💻 Professionally, I've excelled as a Software Engineer, developing my proficiency in Python, Django, ReactJS, React Native, and Node.js. My tech stack also includes extensive work with Java and both front-end and back-end development. I'm also adept at maintaining CI/CD pipelines and version control which ensures efficient and reliable project execution.

🌐 My interests lie in web development, mobile application development, and building robust information systems. I'm currently focused on leveraging Django and React to develop intuitive, scalable applications and also exploring microservices architecture using Moleculer for Node.js.

🚀 Some of my recent projects involve developing a SaaS application integrating Django and React, crafting APIs with Django REST Framework, and building a recipe app API that simplifies culinary adventures.
